## RSA Factoring Challenge

### Brief Description
The RSA Factoring Challenge refers to a series of cryptographic challenges related to the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, which is a key component of the RSA encryption algorithm. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, known as the RSA modulus.

In the RSA Factoring Challenge, participants are typically provided with a specific RSA modulus and are challenged to factor it into its prime components. The purpose of such challenges is to gauge the state of the art in factoring large numbers, as well as to incentivize research in the field of number theory and cryptography.

The RSA Factoring Challenge was initiated by RSA Data Security in 1991. The challenges have varied over the years in terms of the size of the RSA modulus and the associated reward for successfully factoring it. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the RSA Factoring Challenge has seen several successful factorizations, demonstrating both advancements in computational power and algorithmic improvements.

It's worth noting that the specifics of the RSA Factoring Challenge may have evolved since then, and I recommend checking more recent sources for the latest information on any developments in this area.
